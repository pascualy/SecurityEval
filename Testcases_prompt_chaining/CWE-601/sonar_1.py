The code seems to be a function that redirects the user to a target URL obtained from the request. However, it lacks implementation. Here is an example implementation:

```
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

def http_responser_redirect(request):
    '''
    get the target url from the request and redirect to it
    '''
    target_url = request.GET.get('target_url', '/')
    return HttpResponseRedirect(target_url)
```

This implementation uses the `GET` request to obtain the target URL from the request parameters. If the `target_url` parameter is not present, it redirects to the root URL.
