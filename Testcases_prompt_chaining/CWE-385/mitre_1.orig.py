This code does not have any security weaknesses, but it could be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of the function and how it works. Also, it could be useful to add a return statement to indicate whether the passwords match or not. Here's an updated version:

```python
def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    '''
    Compare the actual password with the typed password by checking every character.

    Args:
        actual_pw (str): The actual password.
        typed_pw (str): The password typed by the user.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the passwords match, False otherwise.
    '''
    if len(actual_pw) != len(typed_pw):
        return False
    for i in range(len(actual_pw)):
        if actual_pw[i] != typed_pw[i]:
            return False
    return True
```
