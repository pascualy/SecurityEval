The code seems to be correct and does not have any security weaknesses. However, here's the corrected code with proper indentation and docstring formatting:

```python
def increment_by_one(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, increment each integer by 1
    """
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        arr[i] += 1
    return arr
``` 
This code follows PEP 8 guidelines for naming conventions and uses a for loop to iterate over the array and increment each integer by 1. It also has a proper docstring with formatting according to PEP 257 guidelines.
