This code snippet doesn't have any security weaknesses, but it also doesn't have any functionality. It is just a docstring describing what the function should do, but no actual code is provided. Here's an example implementation of what the function could do:

```python
def convert_to_int():
    """
    Continuously take an input from user and convert it to int within a try-except block
    """
    while True:
        try:
            user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
            num = int(user_input)
            return num
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input, please try again.")
```

This implementation will continuously prompt the user to enter a number, attempt to convert the input to an integer, and return the integer value if successful. If the user enters an invalid input (e.g. a string), it will print an error message and prompt the user to try again. This is just an example implementation and can be modified to fit specific use cases.
