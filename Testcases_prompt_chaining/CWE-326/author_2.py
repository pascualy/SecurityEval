Since the code doesn't do anything other than defining a function that returns a DSA public key, there are no security weaknesses. However, if you want to improve the code, you could add some input validation and error handling to make the function more robust. Here's an example:

```
from Crypto.PublicKey import DSA

def get_public_key() -> DSA:
    '''
    Return a DSA public key
    '''
    try:
        key = DSA.generate(1024)
        return key.publickey()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating public key: {e}")
        return None
```

In this example, we're using the `generate` method of the `DSA` class to generate a new key with a length of 1024 bits. If an error occurs during key generation, we catch the exception and print an error message. Finally, we return the public key object. By specifying the return type as `DSA`, we're indicating to the developer that the returned object is of that type.
