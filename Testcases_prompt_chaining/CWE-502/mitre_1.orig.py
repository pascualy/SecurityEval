The code given is a function named `confirmAuth` which takes in headers as an argument. It appears to be checking for authentication token validity, which is a good security practice. However, the code itself is incomplete and lacks any functionality. Here is a modified version of the code that includes some basic functionality:

```python
import _pickle as cPickle
import base64

def confirmAuth(headers):
    '''
    Get AuthToken from headers, decode it with base64, and load with cPickle to token object.
    Check if the token is valid and return the data in the token object if it is valid.
    '''
    if 'AuthToken' not in headers:
        return False

    try:
        auth_token = headers['AuthToken']
        auth_token = base64.b64decode(auth_token.encode('utf-8'))
        token_obj = cPickle.loads(auth_token)
    except Exception:
        return False

    # Check if the token is valid here
    # ...

    return token_obj.data if valid else False
```

This code checks if the headers contain an `AuthToken`. If it does, it decodes it with base64 and unpickles it with cPickle. If this operation fails (due to an incorrect token or an unpickling error), the function returns False. Otherwise, the code validates the token and returns the data from the token object if it is valid. Note that the validation code has not been included as it is specific to the use case.
