# The code is vulnerable to CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (4.10) as it uses pickle module to serialize and deserialize objects. An attacker can inject malicious code into the serialized data, which will then be executed during the deserialization process. To fix this, we can switch to a safer serialization method like JSON.

# Here's the updated code:

import json
import os

class Payload:
    def get_command_output(self):
        return os.popen('ls').read()

def makeJsonData():
    '''
    get data from Payload and serialize it using JSON before returning it
    '''
    payload = Payload()
    data = {'output': payload.get_command_output()}
    return json.dumps(data)
