This code does not have any security weaknesses. However, as a best practice, you should ensure that the SECRET_KEY setting is properly configured and kept secret. You can generate a new secret key using the following code snippet:

```
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key

SECRET_KEY = get_random_secret_key()
```

You can then replace the SECRET_KEY value in your settings file with the new one generated above.
