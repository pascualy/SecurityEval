The given code does not have any security weaknesses. However, it can be improved by adding exception handling to prevent the code from crashing if an invalid process ID is provided. Here is the updated code:

```python
import os
import signal

def killProcess(processID):
    '''
    Kill the process with the given processID
    '''
    try:
        os.kill(processID, signal.SIGTERM)
        print(f"Process {processID} killed successfully.")
    except OSError:
        print(f"Unable to kill process {processID}. Invalid process ID.")
```

This code will gracefully handle any errors and print a message to the console indicating whether the process was successfully killed or not.
