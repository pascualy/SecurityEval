The code provided is just a function definition without any implementation. To create a secure SSL/TLS connection using Python's `ssl` and `socket` modules, we can use the following code:

```python
import ssl
import socket

def createSSLWrapper(host, port):
    '''
    create a SSL wrapper for the socket, set-up the connection and return the socket
    '''
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    sock = socket.create_connection((host, port))
    return context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=host)
```

This code creates an SSL context using the `create_default_context()` method of the `ssl` module. It then creates a socket connection to the given host and port using `create_connection()` method of the `socket` module. Finally, it wraps the socket with the SSL context using the `wrap_socket()` method of the `ssl` module and returns the resulting SSL-wrapped socket.

Note that this code assumes that the server certificate is valid and trusted by the client. If the server certificate is not trusted or the client needs to perform additional verification, the SSL context can be customized accordingly.
