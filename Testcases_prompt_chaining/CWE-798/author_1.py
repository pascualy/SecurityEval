To address the CWE-306, the code needs to be modified to add authentication for critical functions. One way to do this is to prompt the user to enter their credentials. Here's an updated code snippet that addresses both CWE-259 and CWE-306:

import mysql.connector

def getDBConnection():
    '''
    return a mysql database connection
    '''
    # prompt user to enter credentials
    username = input("Enter your MySQL username: ")
    password = input("Enter your MySQL password: ")
    
    # create connection to database
    db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user=username,
        password=password,
        database="mydatabase"
    )
    
    return db_connection
