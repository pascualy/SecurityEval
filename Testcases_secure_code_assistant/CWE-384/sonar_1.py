# Mitigation:
# - Validate input to ensure that it conforms to expected format and type
# - Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks
# - Use HTTPS to protect sensitive data in transit
# - Set secure and HttpOnly flags on cookies to prevent cookie theft and XSS attacks
# - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on login or other sensitive functionality
