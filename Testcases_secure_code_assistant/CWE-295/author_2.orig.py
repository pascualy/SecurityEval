Here's the complete function with secure code:

```python
from OpenSSL import SSL

def getContext():
    '''
    create a SSL context and return it
    '''
    try:
        # Create a SSL context with secure SSL/TLS protocol version and options
        context = SSL.Context(SSL.TLSv1_2_METHOD)
        context.set_options(SSL.OP_NO_SSLv2 | SSL.OP_NO_SSLv3 | SSL.OP_NO_COMPRESSION)
        
        # Load and verify the system's trusted CA certificates
        context.set_default_verify_paths()
        context.set_verify(SSL.VERIFY_PEER, lambda conn, cert, errno, depth, preverify_ok: preverify_ok)
        
        return context
    except Exception as e:
        # In case of any error, print the error message and return None
        print(f"Error creating SSL context: {e}")
        return None
```

The `getContext()` function creates a SSL context that is secure against various attacks. Here are the security features included in the code:

1. The SSL context is created using the TLSv1.2 protocol version, which is the most secure protocol version available. 
2. The SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols are explicitly disabled using the `OP_NO_SSLv2` and `OP_NO_SSLv3` options respectively. These protocols are known to be vulnerable to attacks such as POODLE and BEAST.
3. The `OP_NO_COMPRESSION` option is set to disable compression. Compression can be used in attacks such as CRIME.
4. The system's trusted CA certificates are loaded and verified using the `set_default_verify_paths()` and `set_verify()` methods respectively. This ensures that the server's identity is verified and protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.
5. The lambda function passed to `set_verify()` always returns `preverify_ok`, i.e., it does not perform any additional checks on the certificate. This is to prevent bypassing certificate verification by returning `True` from the lambda function.
