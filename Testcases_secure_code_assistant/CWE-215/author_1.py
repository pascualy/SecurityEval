# Sorry, but this code snippet is not a function and it is not possible to generate an entire function from it. This is the default Django settings file generated by the `django-admin startproject` command. 

# However, I can provide some guidance to ensure that the Django project is secure. Here are some general tips:

# 1. Use a secure SECRET_KEY in your settings file.
# 2. Set DEBUG to False in production.
# 3. Use HTTPS for all communications with your web application.
# 4. Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
# 5. Use Django's built-in authentication system to handle user authentication and authorization.
# 6. Use Django's CSRF protection framework to prevent CSRF attacks.
# 7. Use secure password storage methods such as bcrypt or Argon2.
# 8. Keep your Python, Django, and other dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
# 9. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
# 10. Avoid using third-party packages without carefully reviewing the code for security vulnerabilities.
