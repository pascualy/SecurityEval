# Mitigation:
# The code uses exception handling to catch any errors that may occur during the reading and parsing of the JSON data. This helps to prevent errors such as connection errors, data errors, and other exceptions that may occur. Additionally, the code uses the "with" statement to ensure that the response is properly closed after it is used, which helps to prevent resource leaks.
