Here's the updated code with security considerations:
```
import os

def dispatchCommand(command, user, args):
    '''
    this function checks the command data and calls the appropriate function
    when command is 'Login', it calls loginUser()
    when command is 'Retrieve_file', it calls sendFile()
    when command is 'List_files', it calls listFiles()
    it does appropriate authentication before calling the function
    '''

    # Define the functions to be called by dispatchCommand
    def loginUser():
        # Implement login user function
        pass
    
    def sendFile():
        # Implement send file function
        pass
    
    def listFiles():
        # Implement list files function
        pass
    
    # Define the user authentication function
    def authenticateUser(username, password):
        # Implement user authentication function
        pass
    
    # Check the command data and call the appropriate function
    if command == 'Login':
        # Call the loginUser function after authentication
        if authenticateUser(user, args):
            loginUser()
    elif command == 'Retrieve_file':
        # Call the sendFile function after authentication
        if authenticateUser(user, args):
            sendFile()
    elif command == 'List_files':
        # Call the listFiles function after authentication
        if authenticateUser(user, args):
            listFiles()
    else:
        # Handle invalid command
        pass
``` 

Note:
1. The code imports os module, which provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system. 
2. The code defines inner functions to be called by dispatchCommand. This is to provide better organization of the code and increase code maintainability. 
3. The code defines an inner function for user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the functions. 
4. The code checks for the command data and calls the appropriate function after user authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the functions.
