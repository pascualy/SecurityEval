Here's the updated code with security considerations:

```
from typing import List

def increment_by_one(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Given an array of integers, increment each integer by 1.
    :param arr: List of integers to be incremented.
    :return: List of integers with each item incremented by 1.
    """
    if not isinstance(arr, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    
    try:
        return [i+1 for i in arr]
    except TypeError:
        raise TypeError("List elements must be integers")
```

Explanation: 

- We use type hints to explicitly define the input and output types of the function, improving readability and helping to catch errors early.
- We check if the input is a list to avoid unexpected behaviors with other types.
- We use a try-except block to catch any TypeError that may occur if a non-integer element is present in the list.
